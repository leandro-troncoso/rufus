			RUFUS was a branding project for a gift shop that began operating during the pandemic. The sales method was through social media and home delivery. The brand's strength was its delivery service during a time of restricted movement, while also aiming to build on the concept of "home," which provided a sense of security during that time.

<br><br>
		<p class="flex-tri-p">
		The brand name was defined as RUFUS, derived from "furnarius rufus," the scientific name of the ovenbird. This bird is particularly known for its nest shaped like a house, but it's also a skilled flier. The colors were also chosen based on the bird. For the style and color palette, we aimed for seriousness but not too somber.
